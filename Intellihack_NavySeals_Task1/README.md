# Intellihack 5.0 - Weather Forecasting Task

## Team Name: NavySeals  
## Task Number: Task1  

---

### **Overview**  
This project focuses on predicting whether it will rain or not based on historical weather data. 
The dataset includes features such as average temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The goal is to build a machine learning model that
can accurately predict rain for hyper-local conditions, helping farmers plan irrigation, planting, and harvesting.
